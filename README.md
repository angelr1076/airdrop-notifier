# ðŸª‚ Airdrop Notifier

A simple Node.js project that monitors RSS feeds for keywords (e.g. _airdrop_, _claim_, _distribution_) and pushes matching posts to a private Discord channel via webhooks.

This project is intended as a **curiosity/learning project** for anyone who wants to experiment with setting up automated notifications in Discord using webhooks.
