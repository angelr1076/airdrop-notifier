# ðŸª‚ Airdrop Notifier

A simple Node.js worker. It polls configured RSS feeds, filters by keywords, and posts matches to Discord via a webhook.

## âœ¨ Features

- Polls any number of RSS or Atom feeds on a schedule
- Matches posts against customizable keywords

  - You'll need to create the Discord channel then in `Settings` click on `Integrations` > `Webhooks`, create a new Webhook, name it and add it to your `.env` as `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL`
- Stores already-seen posts in a ~~local SQLite database~~ Postgres database
- Hosted on Railway
